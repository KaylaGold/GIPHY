GIPHY-REACTIONS 

This app utilizes the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with GIFs of your choice.
The task is completed by calling the GIPHY API and using JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the site.

The user can add their own GIF reaction by inputing their reaction into the text box. When the user clicks the "Submit Gif!" button,
a button with their GIF reaction will populate and join the previously created buttons on the screen.

When the user clicks the GIF button, the page will grab 10 static, non-animated GIF images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the GIF will animate. If the user clicks the GIF again, it will stop playing.
Under each GIF, a rating is displayed for the user.
